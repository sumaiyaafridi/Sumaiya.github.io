I am working as a lecturer from last 3 years, which exposed me to a different teaching techniques, I strongly believe on not to move forward until your confusions are over. I prefer mathematical interpretations of techniques for the related topic. Full command in basics is essential part of my teaching which is done through many revisions and tests. I design my course where for each topic minimum 10 tasks are necessary to perform for better understanding. My emphasis is always on structure when it comes to programming, I developed a strategy where students can be pros in debugging.
