### I have been working as a lecturer at INU for the last 4 years, which exposed me to different teaching techniques, I strongly believe in not moving forward until your confusion is over. I prefer mathematical interpretations of techniques for the related topic. Full command of basics is an essential part of my teaching which is done through many revisions and tests. I designed my course where for each topic minimum of 10 tasks are necessary to perform for better understanding. My emphasis is always on structure when it comes to programming, I developed a strategy where students can be pros in debugging.
